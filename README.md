# MolProPred
* Dealing with [kaggle's competition-Predicting Molecular Properties](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/champs-scalar-coupling/overview).

* Project name given by chatGPT. (prompt: Please give me an ultra-cool project name, the project is for coping with an assignment given by a course '[machine learning for physicist](https://github.com/wangleiphy/ml4p)', there are 3 team members, and the project is about predicting molecular properties.)
