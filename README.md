# MolProPred
* Dealing with [kaggle's competition-Predicting Molecular Properties](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/champs-scalar-coupling/overview).

* Project name given by chatGPT. (prompt: Please give me an ultra-cool project name, the project is for coping with an assignment given by a course '[machine learning for physicist](https://github.com/wangleiphy/ml4p)', there are 3 team members, and the project is about predicting molecular properties.)

* The phonetic symbols for MolProPred are /mɑlproʊprɛd/.

* Good luck. :-)

* AI extensions used in this project: [Genie-AI](https://github.com/ai-genie/chatgpt-vscode), [Github Copilot](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot) for code testing, [New Bing](https://www.bing.com/new?cc=sg&setlang=zh-hans) for literature search, [chatgpt_academic](https://github.com/binary-husky/chatgpt_academic) for fun.
